####What is the <adjective> thing you've ever found?

> [Oldest]: The flints ([image](https://i.redd.it/ahh9x8v5nrz41.jpg)) are nearly 7000 years old. The Denarius coin ([image](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaldetecting/comments/i0qnz3/what_i_thought_was_a_roman_grot_turned_out_to_be/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)) dates to about 80 AD. 

> [Most Valuable]: French posey ring ([image](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaldetecting/comments/iaf6vd/gold_posey_ring_i_found_a_couple_of_weeks_ago_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)) which is worth around Â£1000 ($1300) in a private sale. 

> [Favorite]: The French posey ring along with the Henry VI coin ([image](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtefactPorn/comments/i9cjbz/earlier_i_did_a_live_broadcast_on_reddit_metal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)) and the Elizabeth I coin ([image](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/htm63j/i_found_this_elizabeth_i_penny_while_metal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)). 

> [Strangest]: Had this for a while but no idea what it is ([image](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaldetecting/comments/hddxei/ive_had_this_for_a_while_no_idea_what_it_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)).


####What is your equipment?

> The XP DEUS is currently my primary detector for plowed and shallow detecting. Minelab 3030 is also used for deeper detecting. I also use Garrett Pro-Pointer AT as my "pinpointer". 


####Where are you based out of?

> In South Gloucestershire, England


####What do you do with things you collect?

> They are typically stored in my collection.


####What do you do with valuable or historical items?

> Typically items over 300 years old must be reported as treasure to the local Finds Liaison Officer (FLO) according to the official [Report treasure](https://www.gov.uk/treasure) process. Museums may want to purchase special items and would pay for it. The proceeds from that sale would be split between me and the landowner.
